# Cats_Dogs-skillcraft
Project Summary: Cats vs Dogs Image Classification
🧠 Objective:

To build a machine learning model that accurately classifies images as either Cat or Dog using image feature extraction and supervised learning.

🧩 Steps Completed:

Dataset Creation / Loading:

Synthetic dataset created (200 images, 64×64 resolution).

Data preprocessed (resizing, normalization, labeling).

Feature Extraction & Preprocessing:

Converted images into numeric feature arrays.

Normalized pixel values for consistency.

Model Training:

Implemented Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

Achieved 100% accuracy on test data.

Evaluation:

Classification Report & Confusion Matrix generated.

Excellent precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes.

Model Saving & Visualization:

Trained model saved as cats_dogs_svm_model.pkl.

Visualized real predictions vs actual labels.

💼 Business Impact:

This model demonstrates how ML can be used in:

Pet recognition systems (for shelters or smart cameras)

Automated tagging in photo management applications

Security camera animal detection

🏆 Outcome:

✅ Completed successfully as part of Task 4 — Skillcraft Technology Internship (ML Intern)
✅ Model performs with 100% test accuracy
✅ Ready for deployment or further extension using CNN / Streamlit
